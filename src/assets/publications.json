Most often, this learning approach suffers from the absence of available data, which results in techniques being tested on its dataset. Creating datasets is a cumbersome process requiring researchers to train expert agents from scratch, record their interactions and test each benchmark method with newly created data. Moreover, creating new datasets for each new technique results in a lack of consistency in the evaluation process since each dataset can drastically vary in state and action distribution. In response, this work aims to address these issues by creating Imitation Learning Datasets, a toolkit that allows for: (i) curated expert policies with multithreaded support for faster dataset creation; (ii) readily available datasets and techniques with precise measurements; and (iii) sharing implementations of common imitation learning techniques.

Studying how Imitation Learning approaches learn when dealing with different degrees of quality from the observations can benefit tasks such as optimizing data collection, producing interpretable models, reducing bias when using sub-optimal experts, and more. Therefore, in this work we provide extensive experiments to verify how different Imitation Learning agents perform under various degrees of expert optimality. We experiment with four IL algorithms, three of them that learn self-supervisedly and one that uses the ground-truth labels (BC) in four different environments (tasks), and we compare them using optimal and sub-optimal experts. For assessing the performance of each agent, we compute two metrics: Performance and Average Episodic Reward. Our experiments show that IL approaches that learn self-supervisedly are relatively resilient to sub-optimal experts, which is not the case of the supervised approach. We also observe that sub-optimal experts are sometimes beneficial since they seem to act as a kind of regularization method, preventing models from data overfitting.\",\n\t            KEYWORDS=\"Neural Networks; Deep Learning\",\n\t            URL=\"http://XXXXX/225504.pdf\"\n\t}",
